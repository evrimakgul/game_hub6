# Wiki Log

## [2026-04-27] refresh | character sheet holistic completion
- Reconciled the UI runtime map with the completed character-sheet pass: resistance summary replaces duplicate combat summary stats, detail workspace tabs are top-aligned, and resistance rows remain UI projections over existing mechanics.
- Updated: `runtime/ui-and-routes-map`

## [2026-04-15] ingest | game_hub5 llm wiki bootstrap
- Captured repo docs, tracking docs, current code landmarks, seven Codex threads, two ChatGPT share threads, one ChatGPT follow-up supplement, and external workflow references into `raw/`.

## [2026-04-16] refresh | external snapshot fetch blocked
- Attempted to re-fetch external workflow snapshot sources but the environment has no outbound network access.
- Marked stale in `raw/source-index.md`: `EXT-KARPATHY-GIST`, `EXT-SKILLS-CLAUDE`, `EXT-SKILLS-README`, `EXT-WIKI-SKILL`, `EXT-WIKI-README`.

## [2026-04-16] refresh | wiki provenance and drift reconciliation
- Revalidated the tracked external workflow snapshots against their live upstream URLs and marked them active again in `raw/source-index.md`.
- Revalidated current code landmarks against the wiki's combat, items, powers, and world-casting domain pages.
- Recorded repo-doc drift in the wiki: `references/project_objective.md` still mentions the older manual `Brute Defiance` trigger while current code, roadmap, and notes reflect the passive version.
- Updated: `project/current-objective-and-roadmap`
- Updated: `history/split-decisions`

## [2026-04-16] refresh | aa-01 completion reconciliation
- Reconciled the wiki with the completed `AA-01` implementation so item, knowledge, and roadmap pages no longer describe full Artifact Appraisal integration as pending.
- Reconciled roadmap drift by updating the authoritative plan and supporting docs to match the implemented `AA-01` state.
- Updated: `project/current-objective-and-roadmap`
- Updated: `project/game-hub5-overview`
- Updated: `project/implemented-vs-deferred`
- Updated: `domains/world-casting`
- Updated: `history/split-decisions`
- Updated: `domains/items-and-equipment`
- Updated: `domains/knowledge-cards`

## [2026-04-17] refresh | provenance revalidation
- Revalidated current repo docs and live code landmarks; `references/project_objective.md` remains the only tracked stale current-state doc because it still describes the older manual `Brute Defiance` trigger.
- Revalidated all tracked external workflow snapshot URLs against their live upstream sources and kept the existing raw captures active in `raw/source-index.md`.
- Updated: `history/split-decisions`

## [2026-04-17] refresh | workflow branch policy reconciliation
- Added the missing `CHATGPT-3` raw source for the branch/worktree cleanup conversation and indexed it in `raw/source-index.md`.
- Revalidated all tracked external workflow snapshot URLs against their live upstream sources and kept their existing raw captures active.
- Updated the repo wiki-maintenance rule plus workflow/history pages so wiki refresh work now tracks `codex/powers-implementation` instead of a separate `codex/llm-wiki` lane.
- Updated: `workflow/codex-operating-rules`
- Updated: `workflow/wiki-maintenance`
- Updated: `history/thread-chronology`

## [2026-04-17] refresh | automation rule alignment and provenance revalidation
- Revalidated the tracked external workflow snapshot URLs again during the automation pass and found no material upstream workflow drift.
- Aligned the repo-local `llm-wiki-maintainer` skill with the repo/wiki branch policy so automation and local wiki instructions both point at `codex/powers-implementation`.
- Fixed a minor encoding artifact in `history/thread-chronology`.
- `DOC-OBJECTIVE-01` remains open: `references/project_objective.md` still lags the passive `Brute Defiance` behavior already reflected in code, roadmap, and notes.
- Updated: `history/thread-chronology`

## [2026-04-17] refresh | know-v2 and item-value completion reconciliation
- Reconciled the wiki, roadmap, and tracker pages with the completed `KNOW-V2-01` and `ITEM-VAL-01` implementation.

## [2026-04-18] refresh | unarmored baseline implementation reconciliation
- Reconciled the roadmap, tracker, and wiki with the implemented naked-state initiative rule for humanoid characters.
- Recorded that clothing / robes remain real `Initiative +2, DR +0` chest items, while `apparelMode: humanoid | none` now controls the separate `+3 Initiative` no-chest baseline.
- Marked `python.ipynb` cleanup as the literal last cleanup step instead of a current milestone item.
