## Summary

This page is the compact "what is live versus what is still pending" reference. Use it before assuming a system is still theoretical or still blocked.

## Current State

Implemented and live:

- Local-first character persistence, hydration, and backup recovery.
- Core player/DM data, mechanics, persistence, and live-session repositories.
- UI reset: the previous visual route/component layer has been removed while React/Vite/CSS remain available for a future rebuild.
- Optional Supabase-backed live sessions with Auth, DM Screen, Player Session, persistent events, secret rolls, sharing, and reward packets.
- Combat encounter runtime with initiative, parties, effects, summons, and logs.
- Player combat mode with masked initiative/party/activity views, AE-based opponent reveal, local shared encounter state, and own-turn action controls for the viewing character.
- Power rewrite/reconciliation for the major current power families.
- Knowledge System V1 with standalone revisioned character and item cards.
- Knowledge subject expansion for DM-authored place, faction, story, and custom cards through the DM Knowledge Hub.
- Shared items with persisted category/subcategory definitions and blueprint-backed instances.
- Shared-item value fields with DM-authored `baseStrength`, computed `anchorValue`, and optional `anchorValueOverride`.
- Character-level unarmored baseline handling through `apparelMode: humanoid | none`, with a `+3 Initiative` naked-state bonus only for humanoids who have no chest/body item equipped.
- Standalone DM authoring for:
  - mob templates
  - mob CR control plus live derived-combat summary
  - reusable mob groups
  - group target/party-mean CR control
  - portal templates with nested stages
  - portal/stage difficulty controls
  - manual Codex request-packet import/export, now including portal-first `portal_bundle` imports
- Supplementary slots and anchor-slot occupancy.
- World Casting V1 for a limited set of supported powers.
- `Artifact Appraisal` integration through the inventory shortcut, canonical item-card revision refresh, and linked history-entry flow.

Deferred or partial:

- Encounter persistence beyond current local runtime for offline/dev mode.
- General backend sync outside the live-session layer.
- Full portal-run state / boss-clear reward automation / exit unlocking.
- Broader player combat participation beyond the current own-turn action surface.
- New player/DM UI design and navigation flows on top of the pure service layer.
- Character-sheet image-fidelity pass against the accepted dark reference, preserving the `Resistances` summary replacement and the requested taller second section / smaller first and third sections.
- Timing/action-budget engine.

## Intended Direction

- Keep this page updated whenever a domain moves from "planned" to "live" or from "live but partial" to "closed."
- Use it to stop future threads from re-planning already completed passes.
- Resolve partial systems by upgrading them deliberately rather than collapsing them back into old monoliths.

## Key Decisions

- "Deferred" means intentionally not in the current pass, not forgotten.
- "Implemented" means present in current code and reflected in current notes, even if future expansion remains open.
- The repo should preserve current working item, power, and knowledge foundations while later tasks build on them.

## Deferred / Open

- `COMBAT-ACT-01`
- general backend sync outside configured live sessions
- encounter persistence
- broader player combat participation beyond own-turn controls
- new UI design and visual workflow rebuild
- `NEW-UI-DESIGN-01E` character-sheet image-fidelity pass
- `REPO-CLEANUP-01`
