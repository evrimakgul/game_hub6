## Summary

`game_hub5` is a local-first TTRPG hub for player and DM character management, combat encounters, supernatural powers, shared items/equipment, and revisioned knowledge cards. The repo now has enough history and cross-cutting rules that future work benefits from a persistent compiled wiki instead of rediscovering project intent from raw threads each time.

## Current State

- The repo is now a React/Vite-capable TypeScript core package with the old route-driven visual UI removed.
- Persistence is local-first and centered in pure app data services plus local storage.
- Combat encounter corrections, power-rule reconciliation, Knowledge System V1, item-definition refactor, supplementary slots, and World Casting V1 are already implemented.
- `Artifact Appraisal` is now fully integrated on the inventory/world-casting item-knowledge path.
- Knowledge subject expansion is now live for DM-authored `place`, `faction`, `story`, and `custom` cards.
- Shared items now carry persisted economic anchor data through `baseStrength`, computed `anchorValue`, and optional `anchorValueOverride`.
- Characters now carry an explicit `apparelMode: humanoid | none`, and humanoid characters with no chest/body item equipped now receive a `+3 Initiative` naked-state baseline while clothing/robes remain separate `+2 Initiative` chest items.
- Shared item entities, persisted item category/subcategory definitions, revisioned knowledge records, and the new mob/group/portal authoring records are live project concepts, not just planned concepts.
- DM tooling now includes a standalone mob library with live derived-combat summary output, reusable mob groups with CR-budget controls, and a portal workshop that now serves as the portal-first `portal_bundle` Codex entrypoint before manual stage export into the combat dashboard.
- Combat mechanics still support DM encounter runtime and player-facing masking rules, but the old visual pages have been removed pending a new UI.
- New player/DM UI design is deferred until after the service/core cleanup.
- Canonical non-code project truth currently lives across `references/` and `project_tracking/`, while detailed provenance lives in historical threads and chats.

## Intended Direction

- Keep the product local-first unless backend or sync work is explicitly reopened.
- Preserve the completed combat/power/item/knowledge work and avoid reintroducing removed backend or monolithic-engine assumptions.
- Treat the new authoring workshop as a local-first canonical editor with a manual Codex import/export bridge, not as a live in-app AI chat system.
- Use this wiki as the durable synthesis layer between raw conversations/docs and future implementation.
- Keep "current implementation state" and "intended direction" separate whenever the code has not yet caught up with the latest decision.
- Build the next UI on top of the pure service boundary while preserving hidden-information rules.

## Key Decisions

- `references/plan.md` remains the authoritative implementation roadmap.
- `references/project_objective.md`, `references/current_notes.md`, and the live codebase define current branch state.
- Latest approved conversation direction outranks older conversation intent, but it does not override current implementation facts.
- `History` remains an event log; durable knowledge belongs in standalone revisioned knowledge records.
- Items are modeled as shared entities outside character sheets, with equip state and knowledge handled separately.
- Portal and mob generation remains a manual Codex request/response bridge layered on top of strict data schemas; the previous `/dm/portals` visual entrypoint has been removed with the old UI.

## Deferred / Open

- Full backend sync and richer encounter persistence beyond the current local browser-storage surface remain out of scope.
- The future timing/action-economy layer is still deferred.
- `python.ipynb` cleanup remains deferred to the literal last cleanup step.
- New player/DM UI design is open and should use `AppDataController`, session services, and pure selectors instead of restoring deleted UI connectors.
