## Summary

The current branch objective has shifted to a UI reset. The old visual route/component layer is removed, core mechanics/data remain intact, and the next major product step is a new UI design built on the extracted service layer.

## Current State

- `AA-01` is now complete: inventory `Identify` grants or refreshes the current canonical item-card revision, appends linked history entries, and uses current-revision ownership for hidden bonus visibility.
- `KNOW-V2-01` is now complete: knowledge cards now support DM-authored `place`, `faction`, `story`, and `custom` subjects through `/dm/knowledge`.
- `ITEM-VAL-01` is now complete: shared items now persist `baseStrength`, computed `anchorValue`, and optional `anchorValueOverride`, with DM-only value authoring/display.
- `UNARMORED-BASELINE-01` is now complete: characters now persist `apparelMode: humanoid | none`, clothing/robes stay at `Initiative +2, DR +0`, and humanoid characters with no chest/body item now receive a separate `+3 Initiative` naked-state baseline.
- `AUTHORING-WORKSHOP-01` is now complete: DM tooling now includes standalone mob templates, reusable mob groups, portal templates with nested stages, a manual Codex import/export bridge, a new portal-first `portal_bundle` workflow on `/dm/portals`, explicit CR controls across mobs/groups/portals, and combat-dashboard export of saved groups or portal stages into encounter-owned mobs.
- `ITEM-AUTO-01`, `ITEM-CREATE-01`, and `AUCTION-HOUSE-01` are now complete: the repo now persists auction-house catalog entries, exposes `/dm/auction-house`, and lets DMs auto-create shared item drafts from auction rows while preserving raw bonus text as draft notes.
- `AUCTION-PLAYER-01` is now complete: player character sheets now link into `/player/auction-house`, completed `Bid` and `Buyout` actions spend character money, purchased items land in the buying character's `Items` section, and live auction stock now decrements until it reaches `0`.
- `COMBAT-PLAYER-01` is now complete: DM-started encounters now also expose `/player/combat`, player character sheets and the player hub now link into `Combat Mode` for participating characters, hidden opponents stay masked unless the viewing character owns `Assess Entity` knowledge for that target, and the active encounter persists locally so DM/player windows stay aligned.
- `REALTIME-SESSION-01` is now complete: optional Supabase Auth/session wiring now backs `/dm/screen` and `/player/session` with persistent events, secret rolls, limited sharing, card sharing, and reward packets.
- `UI-RESET-01` is now complete: old route pages, presentation components, UI hooks, navigation wiring, and screen CSS are removed.
- Core app behavior now has pure TypeScript service entrypoints through `AppDataController`, app data persistence helpers, and `OnlineSessionService`.
- New UI design is deferred until after cleanup and may use Figma, Build Web Apps, or hand-tuned React/Vite/CSS.
- `COMBAT-ACT-01` is now intentionally parked at the very end of the project and may be skipped entirely unless priorities change.
- Recent completed milestone groups include:
  - cast UI standardization
  - aura lifecycle cleanup
  - item multi-slot and hand-state cleanup
  - supplementary-slot and item knowledge UX
  - World Casting V1
- `references/plan.md`, `references/current_notes.md`, and `project_tracking/tasks_todo.md` now all reflect the closed `AA-01` state.
- `references/current_notes.md` records successful validation for `typecheck`, `test`, and `build` at the end of the latest major pass.
- `references/project_objective.md` is no longer fully aligned with current implementation; it still mentions the older manual `Brute Defiance` trigger while current code/notes record the passive version.

## Intended Direction

- Start future implementation from the earliest unfinished item in `references/plan.md`, but verify against `references/current_notes.md` and live code first because the plan can lag reality.
- Treat the deferred list as a holding area, not an immediate queue. `COMBAT-ACT-01` should stay parked until the very end of the project and may never be taken.
- Treat full portal-run automation as later follow-up work, not as part of the just-completed authoring workshop pass.
- Treat the wiki as the place that reconciles roadmap intent against current implementation facts.
- Keep future work disciplined around explicit open items rather than restarting already-closed architecture debates.
- Treat the next UI as a fresh design on top of core services, not a restoration of deleted routes/components.

## Key Decisions

- Current roadmap interpretation should prefer explicit "active" and "deferred" lists over stale earlier assumptions.
- Completed domains should be preserved, not reopened casually.
- The wiki should surface where `references/plan.md` and current implementation no longer line up.
- The wiki should also surface partial repo-doc drift when a current-state document lags live code or notes.
- Inventory `Identify` remains the intended user-facing `Artifact Appraisal` surface; AA does not need a second generic world-cast UI.
- The current portal/mob AI workflow is explicitly manual import/export through Codex request packets, not a live website-to-LLM integration.

## Deferred / Open

- reconcile `references/project_objective.md` with the passive `Brute Defiance` behavior now reflected in code and `references/current_notes.md`
- structured parsing of auction-house bonus/effect text into real item mechanics instead of preserved draft-note text
- richer player-side auction behavior such as pending bids, timers, and delayed bid settlement
- richer player-side combat participation beyond the current own-turn action surface
- Supabase RLS policy verification against a real local/project Supabase environment
- email/display-name lookup for adding campaign members instead of user UUID entry
- new player/DM UI design and navigation flows on top of the core service layer
- `COMBAT-ACT-01` timing and action-economy layer, explicitly deferred to the end and possibly out of scope.
- `PORTAL-RUNNER-01` full portal-run state, boss-clear reward automation, exit unlocking, and persistent run orchestration.
- `REPO-CLEANUP-01` remove temporary `python.ipynb` as the literal last cleanup step.
