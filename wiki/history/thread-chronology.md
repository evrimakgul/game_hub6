## Summary

This page is the ordered provenance map for the repo’s recent evolution. It records what each Codex thread or ChatGPT chat contributed so future sessions do not need to rediscover the same context from raw transcripts.

## Current State

| Sequence | Source | Summary | Main Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | Codex thread 1 | Early planning and repo orientation. | Established baseline project understanding. |
| `2` | Codex thread 2 | Continued early powers implementation context. | Preserved power-work rationale. |
| `2.1` | Codex thread 2.1 | Structural refactor and technical-debt split. | Route decomposition, rules relocation, mutation extraction, stylesheet split. |
| `3` | Codex thread 3 | Power-system audit and roadmap correction. | Reconciled what still needed implementation. |
| `4` | Codex thread 4 | Power-system refactor and knowledge-card planning. | Locked the move toward revisioned knowledge cards. |
| `5` | Codex thread 5 | Item blueprint and PP/tier refactor. | Shifted items to blueprint-backed shared instances and richer DM item tooling. |
| `6` | Codex thread 6 | Item definitions, supplementary slots, item knowledge UX, World Casting V1. | Completed current item-definition and world-casting baseline. |
| `ChatGPT 1` | Second Brain for Codex | Explained Karpathy-style persistent wiki concept for Codex. | Established raw/wiki/schema mental model. |
| `ChatGPT 1A` | Follow-up supplement | Clarified setup-once versus run-repeatedly workflow. | Made operational usage loop explicit. |
| `ChatGPT 2` | Best LLM Wiki Repo | Compared repo patterns and Codex compatibility. | Supported repo-tracked wiki decision. |
| `ChatGPT 3` | Branch Management in Codex | Reconstructed the branch/worktree confusion after wiki setup and recommended collapsing back to `codex/powers-implementation`. | Captured the decision to avoid a separate wiki branch unless the user explicitly asks for isolation again. |

## Intended Direction

- Append future thread/chat summaries here instead of recomputing chronology from scratch.
- Keep raw transcripts immutable and use this page as the compact entry point into provenance.
- Prefer canonical digest docs when a thread already has a repo-maintained handoff summary.

## Key Decisions

- `references/session_handoff_2026-03-12.md` is the canonical digest for thread `2.1`.
- `project_tracking/new_thread_context.md` is the compact digest for later item/world-casting threads.
- Raw thread markdown plus original JSONL logs are both preserved for Codex threads.

## Deferred / Open

- Future thread handoffs should keep recording checkpoint/tag details when threads are intentionally closed.
